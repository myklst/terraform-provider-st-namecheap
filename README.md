terraform-provider-st-namecheap
===============================

A Terraform Provider for NameCheap domain management.

## Prerequisites

First you'll need to apply for API access to NameCheap. You can do that on
this [API admin page](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/).

Next, find out your IP address and add that IP (or any other IPs accessing this
API) to this [whitelist admin page](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/whitelisted-ips) on NameCheap.

Once you've done that, make note of the API key, your IP address, and your
username to fill into our `provider` block.
